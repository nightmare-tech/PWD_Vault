## Installation:

Download the zip via `github.com/nightmare-tech/PWD_Vault` or clone it via git :-

```
git clone https://nightmare-tech/PWD_Vault
```

It is a very small repository. So, I didn't need another way to install it. And itâ€™s the easiest :)

- ### For Windows users

    ```
    cd PWD_Vault
    ```

 1. **Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)**

    ```
    python -m venv .
    source bin/activate
    ```

 2. **Install the necessary packages.**
        
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If this produces an error it might the case of a lower C++ Version. You might have to install the python modules manually


 4. **Run the script**

    ```
    PWD_Vault.bat
    ```

     OR

    ```
    cd PWD_Vault
    python PWD_Vault.py
    ```

    After you're done deactivate the "venv" by running `deactivate`.

- ### For Linux users

    ```python
    cd PWD_Vault
    ./PWD_Vault.sh
    ```

    - The bash script checks if there is a virtual environment present, if not it makes a "venv" and installs the dependencies there but if you're using it again then it will detect the "venv", activate it and run the script and deactivate the "venv" after exiting.
    You're Welcome O:)
    - If this produces an error it might the case of a lower C++ Version. You might have to install the python modules manually
